# Temporal Analysis of Comments and Tweets

This repository contains the analysis notebooks for examining the timing of comments on Facebook posts and tweets. These analyses are part of the "Temporal Analysis" project aimed at understanding patterns and trends in the timing of social media interactions.

## Directory Structure

The `temporal_analysis` directory contains the following files:

- `HeyBanco_DataWizzards_Facebook.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook contains the analysis of the timestamps of comments made on Facebook posts. It includes data preprocessing, visualization of comment times, and statistical analysis of peak activity times.

- `HeyBanco_DataWizzards_tweets.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook focuses on analyzing the timestamps of tweets. Similar to the Facebook analysis, it involves data cleaning, a detailed temporal analysis, and visualization of tweet activities over different time frames.

## Getting Started

To run these notebooks, ensure that you have Jupyter installed on your system. You can install it via Anaconda or with pip:

```bash
pip install notebook
```

Once Jupyter is installed, navigate to the `temporal_analysis` directory in your terminal and run:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This command will launch the Jupyter Notebook interface in your browser, where you can open and run the notebooks.

## Prerequisites

The notebooks require the following Python libraries:

- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `matplotlib`: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
- `seaborn`: For high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

These packages can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

To use these notebooks, follow these steps:

1. Open the desired notebook in Jupyter.
2. Run the cells sequentially to perform the analysis.
3. Modify the data paths and parameters as needed to fit your specific data sets and analysis requirements.
